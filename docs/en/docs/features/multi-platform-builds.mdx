Building a production-ready extension with Extension.js is straightforward,
allowing you to bundle your code, optimize assets, and generate ready-to-deploy zip files
for all supported browsers. This guide covers the key features and capabilities
that help you create optimized builds that are ready for the Chrome, Edge, and Firefox stores.

## How Does It Work?

Each browser has its own set of requirements and configurations for extensions. To create a production-ready build of your extension, run the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension build",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension build",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension build",
    bun: "bun x extension build",
  }}
/>

This will create a production build in the `dist/` folder for the default browser (Chrome).
The output includes optimized JavaScript, CSS, and other assets.

## Building for Specific Browsers

You can also target specific browsers using the `--browser` flag:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension build --browser=firefox",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension build --browser=firefox",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension build --browser=firefox",
    bun: "bun x extension build --browser=firefox",
  }}
/>

The resulting build will be placed in `dist/firefox`, including any necessary browser-specific configurations.

## Generating a Zip File

To automatically generate a zip file for distribution, use the `--zip` flag. The zip file will include
all necessary assets and manifest files for the specified browser:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension build --zip",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension build --zip",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension build --zip",
    bun: "bun x extension build --zip",
  }}
/>

The zip file will be named according to the extension's `name` and `version` in `manifest.json`
(e.g., `my-extension-1.0.0.zip` for Chrome).

## Polyfill Support

Ensure compatibility with older browsers by adding the `--polyfill` flag.
This includes necessary polyfills during the build process to ensure your extension runs on older versions of the browser:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension build --polyfill",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension build --polyfill",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension build --polyfill",
    bun: "bun x extension build --polyfill",
  }}
/>

## Best Practices

- **Test Builds**: Test your extension in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

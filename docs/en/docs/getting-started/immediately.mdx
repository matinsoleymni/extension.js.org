# Get Started Immediately

Welcome to the fast track for developing cross-browser extensions with Extension.js. Whether you're quickly prototyping or working on full-scale development, this guide will help you get started right away.

## Kickstart Any Sample from Chrome Extension Samples

Start development by using a sample from the Chrome Extension Samples repository. It's a great way to learn best practices and save time.

### Steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Run the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev <sample-name>",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev <sample-name>",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev <sample-name>",
    bun: "bun x extension@latest dev <sample-name>",
  }}
/>

**Note:** Replace `<sample-name>` with the sample you want to use from [Chrome Extension Samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples).

### Example:

Below, we use the [page-redder sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/sample.page-redder) from [Google Chrome Extension Samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples).

## Use Microsoft Edge to Kickstart Any Sample

Extension.js supports a variety of browsers, including Microsoft Edge. To start an Edge-compatible extension, follow these steps:

### Steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
3. Run this command:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev <sample-name> --browser=edge",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev <sample-name> --browser=edge",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension <sample-name> --browser=edge",
    bun: "bun x extension@latest dev <sample-name> --browser=edge",
  }}
/>

Replace `<sample-name>` with the sample you want to use.

### Example:

Below is an example of using the [magic8ball sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/api-samples/topSites/magic8ball) from [Google Chrome Extension Samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples) and running it on Edge.

## Run Mozilla Add-Ons Using Edge

You can also adapt Mozilla Add-Ons to run on Edge with Extension.js:

### Steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Run this command:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev <addon-name> --browser=edge --polyfill=true",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev <addon-name> --browser=edge --polyfill=true",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension <addon-name> --browser=edge --polyfill=true",
    bun: "bun x extension@latest dev <addon-name> --browser=edge --polyfill=true",
  }}
/>

This will fetch a Mozilla Add-On and adapt it for Edge.

### Example:

Below is an example of fetching the [Apply CSS sample](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/main/apply-css) from [MDN WebExtensions Examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) and running it on Edge.

## Tips to Get Started

- **To use TypeScript**, add a `tsconfig.json` file to the root of your project.
- **To use React**, add React as a dependency in your `package.json`.
- Any `tsconfig.json` with React support will make your project ready for React and TypeScript.
- If you need to handle assets not declared in the manifest, learn more about [Special Folders](../features/special-folders.mdx).

## Best Practices

- **Use the `extension` package**: The `extension` package provides a set of commands to help you build, run, and deploy your extension. It also offers a variety of templates to kickstart your project.
- **Use the `--browser` flag**: The `--browser` flag allows you to specify the target browser for your extension. This ensures that your extension is compatible with the browser you're targeting.
- **Use the `--polyfill` flag**: The `--polyfill` flag helps you adapt Mozilla Add-Ons to run on Edge. It fetches the necessary polyfills to ensure compatibility.
